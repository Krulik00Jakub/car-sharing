### 0. Introduction:  
The car sharing information system project aims to address the increasing problem of crowded streets and resource wastage caused by personal vehicles that are used for short periods of time. By implementing a car sharing system, residents will have the option to utilize vehicles as needed, paying only for the time/distance they cover during their activities. To effectively manage this pilot project and facilitate seamless car sharing, an information system is essential. This system will handle reservations, track shared resources (vehicles), manage user information, and provide interfaces for GPS tracking, financial transactions, and online ordering. In the following paragraphs, we will explore different aspects of the project, including determining use-cases and business needs, modelling the problem domain, system inputs and outputs, modelling design classes, and designing the three-tier architecture. 
### I. Determination of use-cases and business needs:  
In this phase of the project, the focus is on identifying the key use-cases and understanding the business needs that the car sharing information system should address. Use-cases represent the interactions between different actors (users, system, external entities) and the system itself. By analyzing these use-cases, the development team can gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's functionality and the tasks it needs to perform. Additionally, capturing the business needs helps in aligning the system's objectives with the overarching goals of the car sharing project. It ensures that the system fulfills the requirements of both the users and the stakeholders involved.

### II. Modelling the Problem Domain:  
Modelling the problem domain involves creating a conceptual representation of the real-world environment in which the car sharing information system operates. This step helps in identifying and defining the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. By constructing an accurate problem domain model, the development team can gain insights into the structure and behavior of the system. It also aids in defining the boundaries of the system and understanding how it interacts with external entities. Through this modelling process, the team can ensure that the system accurately reflects the requirements of the car sharing project.

### III. System Inputs and Outputs:
System inputs and outputs are crucial aspects of the car sharing information system, as they determine how users interact with the system and the responses generated by the system. Inputs include information provided by users, such as vehicle reservations, payment details, and reporting vehicle issues. Outputs encompass the system's responses, such as confirmation messages, generated receipts, and notifications. Understanding the inputs and outputs helps in designing user-friendly interfaces and defining the required data processing and storage mechanisms. By analyzing these aspects, the development team can ensure efficient and effective communication between users and the car sharing information system.

### IV. Modelling Design Class Diagrams:  
In this phase, the focus shifts towards modelling the design classes of the car sharing information system. Design classes represent the objects and their attributes, methods, and relationships within the system. By creating a class diagram, the development team can visualize the structure of the system and the interactions between different objects. This modelling process helps in organizing and managing the system's complexity, defining the responsibilities of each class, and establishing the relationships and dependencies between them. Accurate modelling of design classes lays the foundation for the implementation phase of the project.

This phase of the project was completed in two iterations. The first iteration took a higher level approach to modelling the classes/objects in the system along with an event sequence for the system:

In the second iteration of this phase, the design class diagram was expanded adding the required functions/methods for each class (getters, setters, etc.). The Data layer control classes are also added for clarity:

### V. Modelling the Three-Tier Architecture:
The three-tier architecture is a fundamental design approach for developing robust and scalable systems. In the context of the car sharing information system, this architecture consists of three layers: the view layer, the application layer, and the data layer. The view layer handles the user interface, allowing users to interact with the system. The application layer contains the business logic, processing user requests, and coordinating system functions. The data layer manages the storage and retrieval of data, ensuring data integrity and security. By modelling the three-tier architecture, the development team can plan and organize the system's components effectively, providing a solid foundation for the system's implementation.

In this final iteration of the project, the system sequence diagram is expanded upon to match with the business needs, use cases, and final design class model of the system:

This iteration also concluded with the development of the final tier of the commonly use three-tier architecture, the view layer:
